     <h1>Karthikeya 2</h1>
     <p>
        Karthikeya 2 tells the story of a young boy with a lot of curiosity who took on a project that ended with the death of an archeologist who tried to protect Lord Krishna's anklet that has medicinal values from the owners of pharmacy industries. The struggle that hero went through to protect that anklet, as well as the history behind that anklet, piqued my interest in watching this film, and when my expectations were met, this film became one of my favorites.
